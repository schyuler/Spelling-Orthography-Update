# Spelling-Orthography-Update
This project uses machine learning to update text from an older spelling orthography to a modern spelling orthography. The focus on this project will be on updating the spelling orthography from the 1908 Chamorro Bible. **Project Status: In Progress**

## About this data
This project uses the text from the 1908 Chamorro Bible, a partial translation of the Kinge James Bible. This text can be found and downloaded for free at http://chamorrobible.org/. <br>
The 1908 Chamorro Bible contains the four gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Boook of Psalms. This translation was written in an older style, Spanish-influenced spelling orthography, which different letters than the current moddern orthography (i.e.: it uses the letter "j" for what is now written with the letter "h"). Some modern letters it does not use at all, with the most notable absence being the glota (') which is used in modern orthographies to indicate glottal stops and affixes. It also collapses multiple words into single words, usually attaching pronouns to the beginning or ends of words (i.e.: *jucantaye* in the old orthgraphy is *hu kant√•yi* in the modern orthography).

## Benefits of this project
The old-style Spanish orthography makes this text difficult for modern Chamorro language learners and speakers to read. Updating this orthography will provide the Chamorro people with a valuable, free resource in the Chamorro language, which can be used to support their language learning efforts. It may also support future researchers in the study of the Chamorro language, particularly in assessing how the language hase changed in the over 100 years since the 1908 Chamorro Bible's initial publication.

Finally, exploring machine learning methods for updating the orthography may open new possibilities for taking other, older texts and automating the process of updating their orthographies to make them more widely accessible for modern audiences. This can also be a viable and accessible option for minority communities and languages such as Chamorro, where language resources to undertake such work manually may be unavailable.

## Features
- Scrapes the text directly from ChamorroBible.org and cleans it
- Importing a small set of manually created sample pairs for our training set
- Training, tuning and evaluating different machine-learning models. (Specifics will be added later)
- An updated word list, and the results exported as a .CSV file
- An updated text of the 1908 Chamorro Bible
